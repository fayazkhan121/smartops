# SmartOps - Streamlined CI/CD & Infrastructure Management

## Overview
SmartOps is a comprehensive DevOps automation platform that integrates CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure provisioning, monitoring, and incident management into a single, scalable system.

## Project Structure
- `ci_cd/`: CI/CD pipeline configurations
- `iac/`: Infrastructure as Code scripts
- `monitoring/`: Monitoring and alerting configurations
- `orchestration/`: Kubernetes and Helm configurations
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for cost optimization
- `security/`: Vault configurations for secret management

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the setup instructions in each directory's README.

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Jenkins (for CI/CD)
- Terraform
- Ansible
- AWS CLI
- Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
- Helm
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Python
- HashiCorp Vault

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fayazkhan121/smartops.git
cd smartops

# Set Up CI/CD Pipelines
# Jenkins
- Install Jenkins on your machine or use a Jenkins server.
- Copy the Jenkinsfile from ci_cd/jenkins/ to your Jenkins job configuration.
# GitHub Actions
- Ensure your repository is on GitHub.
- The main.yml file in ci_cd/github_actions/ will automatically trigger on push events.
- Provision Infrastructure

# Terraform
- Navigate to the iac/terraform/ directory.
- Initialize Terraform:
terraform init


- Apply the Terraform configuration:
terraform apply

# Ansible
- Navigate to the iac/ansible/ directory.
- Run the Ansible playbook:
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory

# Set Up Monitoring

### Prometheus
- Navigate to the monitoring/prometheus/ directory.
- Start Prometheus using the configuration file:
prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fayazkhan121/smartops.git
cd smartops

# Grafana
- Navigate to the monitoring/grafana/ directory.
- Start Grafana using the configuration file:
grafana-server --config=grafana.ini

# Deploy to Kubernetes
## EKS
- Ensure you have an EKS cluster set up.
- Navigate to the orchestration/kubernetes/ directory.
- Apply the Kubernetes deployment:
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml

### Helm
- Navigate to the orchestration/helm/ directory.
- Install the Helm chart:
helm install example-chart .

# Set Up Security
### HashiCorp Vault
- Navigate to the security/vault/ directory.
- Start Vault using the configuration file:

vault server -config=vault_config.hcl

# Run Cost Optimization Script
- Navigate to the scripts/ directory.
- Run the Python scrip:
python cost_optimization.py

## How This Project Helps in Daily Life

The SmartOps project provides a comprehensive DevOps automation platform that helps in the following ways:

### Automates Repetitive Tasks
- CI/CD pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment processes, reducing manual intervention and errors.

### Infrastructure Management
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform and Ansible allows for consistent and repeatable infrastructure provisioning and configuration.

### Monitoring and Alerts
- Real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana provides insights into application and infrastructure health.
- Custom alerts ensure that issues are detected and addressed promptly.

### Container Orchestration
- Kubernetes (EKS) and Helm simplify the deployment and management of containerized applications, ensuring scalability and reliability.

### Cost Optimization
- Automated scripts identify and terminate idle resources, helping to reduce cloud costs.

### Security
- HashiCorp Vault ensures secure management of secrets and credentials, enhancing security and compliance.

### Incident Management
- Integration with alerting tools like Slack ensures that incidents are escalated and managed efficiently.

By integrating these components into a single platform, SmartOps streamlines DevOps workflows, improves efficiency, and enhances the overall reliability and scalability of your infrastructure and applications.
